## Steps to run the project
Step 1: Create the .env file (see the step below.)

Step 2: Clone the Repo

Step 3: Change Directory into the cloned repo.

Step 4: Run Docker Compose 

### .env File
Create an .env file.
Add the Printer IP you configured when you setup your printer.
Add the Printer Password from the Printer Network Settings Menu.
Add the MQTT_TOPIC for your printer. This can be achived by loading up an MQTT Application such as MQTT Explorer. 
- You must Enable (TLS), use the protocol mqtt://, add the port 8883, username bblp, and the password on your printer. 
- *Please note you can regenerate a password on the device manually.
- Collect the MQTT_TOPIC by expanding the "Device", "Serial Number", "Report". The result should look similar to "device/00M00A2B08124765/report"

```
BAMBU_PRINTER_IP=""
USERNAME="bblp"
PASSWORD=""
MQTT_TOPIC="device/00M00A2B0809765/report"
```

```
git clone
cd Bambulabs-Exporter
docker-compose up -d
```


## (Important Notes)
You will need to likely run an MQTT program to test your connection. You can pull the password from the printer interface manually, or reset it on the printer itself.

### Prometheus Ingestion
Setup prometheus to scrape the node and setup the ports to pull from port 9101.

### Future Development
Add Kubernetes Configs
