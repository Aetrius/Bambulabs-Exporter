# BAMBULABS EXPORTER
This is an exporter for all the data peeps that want to know all the things about their awesome BambuLabs 3D Printer. This was only tested on the X1C.

## Prereqs
This project assumes you have a Grafana/Prometheus Setup. You would point your Prometheus instance to the (host:9101) endpoint. This is not a tutorial on Prometheus / Grafana.
This program/container would run on a virtual host, raspberry pi, or a computer that has access to the Bambu printer. IT is possible to port forward your printer and host this in AWS or offpremise. Watch the video for the steps to run Prometheus/Grafana with the Bambulabs exporter.

- Install Git (only for windows)
- Install Docker
- Install Docker-Compose


## GO, DOCKER, & PROMETHEUS âš¡ Powered
This is an MQTT Exporter powered by Go & Docker.

## Tutorial (for Monitoring stack (prometheus + grafana) + Bambulabs exporter)
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQSAEKGYJBQ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQSAEKGYJBQ)
- (Use the steps below if you just want to run the exporter and assuming you have a Prometheus/Grafana stack already).
- If your monitor-compose.yml file will not start without a docker network. Run the following command `docker network create bambulabs-exporter_default`.

---

## Steps to run the project
``` 
Step 1: Create the .env file (see the step below.)

Step 2: Clone the Repo

Step 3: Change Directory into the cloned repo.

Step 4: Run Docker Compose 
```

---

### .env File
Create an .env file.
Add the Printer IP you configured when you setup your printer.
Add the Printer Password from the Printer Network Settings Menu.
Add the MQTT_TOPIC for your printer. This can be achived by loading up an MQTT Application such as MQTT Explorer. 
- You must Enable (TLS), use the protocol mqtt://, add the port 8883, username bblp, and the password on your printer. 
- *Please note you can regenerate a password on the device manually.
- Collect the MQTT_TOPIC by expanding the "Device", "Serial Number", "Report". The result should look similar to "device/00M00A2B08124765/report"

```
BAMBU_PRINTER_IP=""
USERNAME="bblp"
PASSWORD=""
MQTT_TOPIC="device/00M00A2B08124765/report"
```

```
git clone
cd Bambulabs-Exporter
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## (Important Notes)
You will need to likely run an MQTT program to test your connection. You can pull the password from the printer interface manually, or reset it on the printer itself.

---

### Prometheus Ingestion
Setup prometheus to scrape the node and setup the ports to pull from port 9101.

---

### Bugs
- 3/4/2023 - Possible bug with docker networking on monitor-compose. Added solution to readme. Pending review.

---

### Feature Changes
- 3/4/2023 - Added new Metrics ams_humidity, ams_temp, ams_tray_color, ams_bed_temp. These include ams number and tray numbers to be dynamic depending on how many AMS's are included.

---

### Future Development
- Add Kubernetes Configs
- Add Grafana Dashboard changes for AMS
